## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Sass is powerful.

Specificity issues can still occur. I'm currently adapting a style where the media queries are not nested. I am also target each element by including its ancestors to make sure it doesn't lose the specificity battle with any other declarations above it. I can afford it since I can make do with shorter classnames with sass' nested declarations over bem cuz I like my html clean. :)
